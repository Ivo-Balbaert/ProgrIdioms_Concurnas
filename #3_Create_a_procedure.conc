// Idiom #3 - Create a procedure:
// Like a function which doesn't return any value, 
// thus has only side effects (e.g. Print to standard output)

def finish (name String) {
  // System.out.println("My job here is done. Good bye from " + name)
  System.out.println("My job here is done. Good bye from {name}")
}

finish('Ivo')

// Output:
// My job here is done. Good bye from Ivo
